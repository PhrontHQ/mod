# Data Objects

Data Objects are designed to help model a certain domain of knowledge or business. They are intended to capture the essential concepts, entities, and relationships within that domain.

Data Objects are also designed to facilitate data management, processing, and communication between systems. They abstract end-modders from having to worry about how Data Objects are persisted in databases or API, which simplifies work and the ability to change the sybsystems used storage without impacting applications

### Key Characteristics of Data Objects

1. **Representation of Entities** :
   * Data objects represent real-world entities or concepts within the domain. For example, in a retail business, data objects might represent customers, products, orders, and inventory.
2. **Properties**
   * Data objects have properties that describe its characteristics. For instance, a **`Customer`** **object might have attributes like** **`customerID`,** **`name`,** **`email`, and**`phoneNumber`.
3. **Relationships**
   * Data objects can have relationships with other objects. These relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. For example, an **`Order`** **object might be related to multiple** **`Product`** **objects and a single** **`Customer`** object.
4. **Domain-Specific Logic**
   * Data objects encapsulate domain-specific logic and rules. This ensures that the objects behave consistently with the business rules and constraints of the domain. For instance, an **`Inventory`** object might enforce rules about stock levels and reorder points.
5. **Data Integrity and Validation** :
   * Data objects often include validation rules to ensure data integrity. These rules can check for required fields, valid data types, and other constraints. For example, an** **`Email`** **attribute might require a valid email format.

### Examples of Data Objects

1. **E-commerce Domain** :
   * **Customer** : Attributes like** **`customerID`,** **`name`,** **`email`,** **`address`. Methods like** **`placeOrder()`,** **`updateProfile()`.
   * **Product** : Attributes like** **`productID`,** **`name`,** **`price`,** **`stockQuantity`. Methods like** **`calculateDiscount()`,** **`updateStock()`.
   * **Order** : Attributes like** **`orderID`,** **`customerID`,** **`orderDate`,** **`totalAmount`. Methods like** **`addProduct()`,** **`calculateTotal()`.
2. **Healthcare Domain** :
   * **Patient** : Attributes like** **`patientID`,** **`name`,** **`dateOfBirth`,** **`medicalHistory`. Methods like** **`scheduleAppointment()`,** **`updateMedicalHistory()`.
   * **Appointment** : Attributes like** **`appointmentID`,** **`patientID`,** **`doctorID`,** **`dateTime`. Methods like** **`reschedule()`,** **`cancel()`.
   * **Medication** : Attributes like** **`medicationID`,** **`name`,** **`dosage`,** **`prescriptionDate`. Methods like** **`refill()`,** **`updateDosage()`.

### Benefits of Using Data Objects

1. **Clarity and Organization** :
   * Data objects provide a clear and organized way to represent and manage domain-specific information.
2. **Reusability** :
   * Well-defined data objects can be reused across different parts of the application or even in different applications within the same domain.
3. **Consistency** :
   * Encapsulating domain-specific logic within data objects ensures consistent behavior and adherence to business rules.
4. **Maintainability** :
   * Changes to the domain model can be made in a centralized manner, making the system easier to maintain and update.

In summary, data objects model a certain domain of knowledge or business as a structured representations of information that capture the essential entities, properties, relationships, and rules/logic within that domain. They facilitate data management, processing, and communication in a way that aligns with the specific needs and context of the domain, ensuring clarity, consistency, and maintainability
